# SolarScope AI - Replit Configuration

## Overview

SolarScope AI is an AI-powered solar panel analysis platform that leverages Google Gemini AI to provide two main services:
1. **Installation Planning**: Analyzes rooftop images to recommend optimal solar panel placement
2. **Fault Detection**: Identifies defects and performance issues in existing solar panel installations

The application is built as a full-stack web application with a React frontend and Express.js backend, designed for deployment on Vercel with serverless functions.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **File Upload**: React Dropzone for drag-and-drop image uploads

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js with ES modules
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini AI for image analysis
- **File Handling**: Multer for multipart file uploads
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- **Environment**: Cross-platform development with cross-env

### Deployment Strategy
- **Frontend**: Vercel static hosting
- **Backend**: Local development only
- **Static Assets**: Frontend built to `/dist/public`
- **Database**: Configured for local development with in-memory storage

## Key Components

### AI Analysis Service (`server/ai-service.ts`)
- Integrates with Google Gemini AI for computer vision analysis
- **STRICT VALIDATION**: Validates image content and file size limits
- **CONTENT CLASSIFICATION**: AI-powered image classification ensures:
  - Installation analysis ONLY accepts rooftop/building images
  - Fault detection ONLY accepts solar panel images
  - Rejects inappropriate content with clear error messages
- Provides detailed analysis results with recommendations
- Enhanced error handling with user-friendly validation messages

### Image Processing Pipeline
1. **Upload**: Multer handles file uploads to temporary storage
2. **Validation**: File size, type, and content validation
3. **STRICT CLASSIFICATION**: AI-powered content verification ensures:
   - Rooftop images for installation analysis (rejects solar panel images)
   - Solar panel images for fault detection (rejects rooftop images)
   - Clear error messages for inappropriate uploads
4. **Analysis**: Gemini AI processes validated images for installation or fault detection
5. **Results**: Structured JSON responses with actionable insights

### Database Schema (`shared/schema.ts`)
- **Users**: Basic user management (id, username, password)
- **Analyses**: Storage for analysis results with JSON data
- **Chat Messages**: Real-time messaging with user attribution and categorization
- **Types**: TypeScript schemas for type safety across frontend/backend

### Frontend Components
- **Dashboard**: Main interface with tabbed navigation
- **Image Upload**: Drag-and-drop interface with preview
- **Analysis Results**: Visual display of AI analysis results
- **Analysis Overlay**: Canvas-based visualization of detected regions/faults
- **AI Chat System**: Dedicated AI-powered chat page with professional interface, quick prompt buttons, and comprehensive solar panel expertise

## Data Flow

1. **Image Upload**: User uploads rooftop/solar panel image via drag-and-drop interface
2. **Server Processing**: Express.js receives multipart form data via Multer
3. **AI Analysis**: Google Gemini AI analyzes the image and returns structured results
4. **Data Storage**: Analysis results stored in PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
5. **Result Display**: Frontend receives JSON response and renders visual analysis
6. **Interactive Visualization**: Canvas overlay shows detected regions or faults
